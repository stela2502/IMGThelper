# Population based analysis of IMGT data

This part is based on the R scriptes written by Stijn Vanhee and was implemented as R package by me, Stefan Lang.

The package is expecting the user to have stored single IMGT result table sets in different folders. 
And therefore the package used only this sample specific path at creation:

```{r}
##here I need an example dataset ....
```
